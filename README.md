The code is based on Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller course in Udemy with some changes and code styling improvements.

[React-BurgerShop](https://github.com/PavelApostolov/ReactJS-BurgerShop) app refactored with Redux more convenient access to the state by the different components. It lets you design a tasty burger with ingredients and their quantity of your choice. 

# How does it work

You can add and remove different ingredients and you can see the immediate result of your creation as a burger designed with CSS. The price is also updated with every click. You have to be authenticated to make an order.

After building your burger a modal with the order summary pops. After confirmation you are redirected to a contacts page where you fill a form for delivery and finish your order. It is stored in Firebase database.

Added features after refactoring with Redux: authentication(register, login, logout), guarding routes, asynchronous requests and lazy loading, unit tests. 
Used: Firebase, ReactRouter 4, Axios, Redux-Thunk
